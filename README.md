<h2 style='color:rgb(167, 22, 102)'> Random Key Generator</h2>
Random key generator used for One Time Passcode or to generate a random string.

## Step 1
Generate a random 9 character string using python random.choice from a list of characters generally required in a strong password.

## Step 2
Code Test
Run code to see if any random password is generated more then once and test the randomness frequency test:
This function will return a value between 0 and 1. The closer the result is to 0, the more likely the sequence is to be random (according to the frequency test).
'''def frequency_test(sequence)'''

## Step 3
Scan Vulnerabilies using SNYK

## Step 4
Front End using Flask to run code on a click.

## Step 5
Launch 'site' to test agains ZAP for further vulnerabilities
